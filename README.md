# SESYNC_HABs
This is our read-me.

In this mini-progject we're going to create a repository with these datasets on harmful microbial bloms in Lake Erie:

*Media Data
This dataset covers newspaper,radio, and on-line news stories with some relation to harmful microbial blooms from 2005-2015. We sampled national a state-level media outlets

*Perception Data
This dataset was compiled from household-level surveys regarding the perception of HABs in the lake.

*HABs Data
This dataset provides measurements of N, P, and various microbial populations at specific sampling stations in the lake.

*Tributary Data
These datasets provide flows of N, P, etc. for all trbutaries to the lake.
