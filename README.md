# SESYNC_HABs
This is our read-me.

In this mini-project we're going to create a repository with these datasets on harmful microbial blooms in Lake Erie:

*Media Data
This dataset covers newspaper,radio, and on-line news stories with some relation to harmful microbial blooms from 2005-2015. We sampled national a state-level media outlets

*Perception Data
This dataset was compiled from household-level surveys regarding the perception of HABs in the lake.

*HABs Data
This dataset provides measurements of N, P, and various microbial populations at specific sampling stations in the lake.

*Tributary Data
These datasets provide flows of N, P, etc. for all tributaries to the lake.

*Nonpoint Source Policy Data
This dataset contains a compilation of policies, regulations, and voluntary programs in jurisdictions within watersheds bordeirng Lake Erie that are in place to combat the negative effects of nonpoint source pollution. This dataset provides information about national, state, and county level policies that work to prevent the build up of harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie. The dataset measures type of policy, strength of policy, and incentives used in each policy.

*SVI data
Data to be included will be from the Social Vulnerability Index, which is composed of 16 factors related to socioeconomic, demographic, and household composition conditions. Factors which fall in the 90th percentile for a region are flagged as higher risk, and regions which contain higher numbers of flags indicate regions in which additional resources may be required to address those at higher risk during natural disasters (hurricanes, floods, etc.).
