Data to be included will be from the Social Vulnerability Index, which is composed of 16 factors related to socioeconomic, demographic, and household composition conditions. Factors which fall in the 90th percentile for a region are flagged as higher risk, and regions which contain higher numbers of flags indicate regions in which additional resources may be required to address those at higher risk during natural disasters (hurricanes, floods, etc.).
